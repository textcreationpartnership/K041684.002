1. SONGS.

    _ SONG, ſung by Mr. LOWE, at Drury-lane Theatre, 20th November, 1740After the performance of the TEMPEST, for the Benefit of Captain Pedlie's Crew, who on this occaſion came on the Stage, and returned thanks; the Prince of Wales, Father of his preſent Majeſty, honoured the Theatre writh his attendance. Captain Peddie was Commander of the Prince of Orange, homeward bound from St. Chriſtopher's. Oct. 23, after a tedious paſſage, about 30 leagues E. of Scilly, he was attacked by a Spaniſh Privateer of •8 guns, as many ſwivels, and 150 Men. The Spaniards holſting Engliſh Colours, Capt. Peddie had no ſuſpicion of him till he was cloſe on board, when his adverſary poured in a broadſide upon him with all his ſmall arms. Captain Peddie's guns being all wet below, he coud only return him his quarter deck guns and ſmall arms; but clapping the helm hard a-weather, he had the courage to run him aboard on the quarter, which did him conſiderable damage. When the Spaniard got clear, he ſhot ahead and lay by a quarter of an hour, which gave the captain time to get ready for him; and on his bearing down again, a ſmart engagement enſued for about three hours and a half; when the Don bore away, and Captain Peddie after him; but finding he outſailed him, he clapped upon a wind, and continued his voyage with a favourable wind till he arrived in the Downs, October 30, having loſt but four men and five wounded. After ſo brave a deliverance he was ſcarcely anchored, before, by a violent ſtorm, his ſhip was driven a ſhore and loſt; himſelf narrowly eſcaping, and five of his crew having periſhed with the cold. The gallant behaviour of this Gentleman, and his ſubſequent misfortunes, made a deep impreſſion on the publick. On the 20th November 1740, CATO was acted at Covent Garden for his Benefit. His Majeſty ſent him 100 Guineas, the Dutcheſs of Marlborough 20, and Mr. Onſlow, Speaker of the Houſe of Commons, with many of the Nobility, made him preſents to the value of near 3000 pounds. Soon after he had given him the Command of the Baſiliſk Bomb. The above Song was written by Mr. Walmſley, the patron of Mr. Garrick, and the friend of Doctor Johnſon, except the third Stanza, which was added by Mr. Garrick himſelf.
